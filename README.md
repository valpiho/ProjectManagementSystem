# Project Management System
### Introduction

This project management system is a final Project for SDA's Java from Scratch course. Main aim was to practice using Spring Boot, but we also did some front-end development to get more familiar with front-end technologies. 
The aim of this application is to manage projects, tasks and people who are included in these projects. To simplify the task we thought of the application as an in-house project management system for the organizationâ€™s software development team. 

### Technologies 
Spring Boot + Java 11, 
MySQL, 
Spring MVC, 
Spring Data JPA, 
ThymeLeaf, 
CSS Bootstrap5
